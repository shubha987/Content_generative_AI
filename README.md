# Content_generative_AI
This repository holds the requirements for the required personalized content generation AI for users in the event of INNOVATE4SWADESHI conducted by KodeinKGP.

## Problem Statement :
Personalized Content Generation AI for Users

### Problem description :
The challenge for this hackathon is to create an AI-powered system that generates personalized content, such as social media posts or written works, emulating a user's writing style and thought process.
